## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **Business Understanding**  
2. **Data Understanding** – 3 datasets, feature engineering (30+ features), data quality checks.  
3. **Data Preparation** – cleaning, encoding, handling imbalanced data with SMOTE.  
4. **Modeling & Evaluation** – tested 4 models:  
   - Random Forest  
   - Decision Tree (Best model, tuned hyperparameters)  
   - XGBoost  
   - KNN  
5. **Evaluation** – high performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.  
6. **Recommendations** – promo targeting, price management, customer activity segmentation, age-based personalization, time-pattern strategies, shipping cost analysis.
